                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">The European political situation, as almost everyone now realizes, <b>has a bleak outlook;</b> if it continues on its current trajectory, <b>it risks sliding into total decay and disintegration.</b> Decades of stagnation, wrong policies, uncommitted elites, unresponsive "decision makers", and a generalized lack of guideship (at the European and national levels)— are laying the fertile ground for the consolidation of a major crisis, one that is about to come, or is even already here</p>
                                
                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Europe, which once was able to navigate toward a better shore, now (continuously) heading toward an iceberg, as a big massive old ship that sees what is ahead, but is unable to maneuver. Prospects for economic obsolescence, the non-stop rise of anti-European (left and right) regressive forces, the unaffordable rise in living costs, lack of transparency and corruption, growing organized crime, and the imminent danger of the drainage of resources by hostile foreign actors— <b>are putting Europe close to a non-return point</b>, one that, if reached, make a shift in direction becomes almost impossible.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">All of this occurs in a <b>global context of deteriorating global situation.</b> One that goes from the rise of warfare, the imminent impact of unchecked technologies, fierce geopolitical competition, uncontrolled pollution, the deterioration of multilateral institutions, the radicalization of violence and hatred, man-made famines, ethnic cleansing processes, and many other manifestations that mark (sadly) our present era.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="po-sidebar-text-1">
                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>The opportunistic rise of the reactionary-international</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">The slowly deteriorating European political landscape, which manifests itself in a generalized downward trend of living conditions, societal cohesion, and general economic performance—is becoming <b>fertile ground for the emergence of regressive forces</b>, that want to bring us back to a polluted high-tech version of the Middle Ages: a society that is not for everyone, but for a few, where the majority of people are marginalized, segregation is the norm, corruption is rampant, and the prospects for a good life for the average person are completely gone</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This dystopian scenario is not something from science fiction, but that is going on now, <b>anchored in the ideology of the <em>reactionary-international</em>:</b> a marriage between the ultra-conservative and the big-tech anarcho-capitalists. Which combines medieval-religious-ethnic values with a massive concentration of wealth, digital surveillance, and techno-feudalism structures.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This is expressed by the <b>alignment of European medieval forces with <em>Trumpism</em></b>, which is a combination of a Silicon Valley tech-lords groups with the evangelical pseudoreligious forces coming from the United States— which <b>want to export their regime to Europe</b>, to drain any of the resources that our region still has.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="po-sidebar-text-1">
                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>An outdated "progressive" camp</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">The emergence of the <em>reactionary-international</em> <b>is not a coincidence</b>, nor entirely because of the will of these bad actors— but (mainly) is a product of decades of failed policies, institutional decay, and the overall misguided or insufficient (sometimes intentional) practices that came from the <em>regressive left,</em> the <em>overly-liberal radical-centrists,</em> and the increasingly complicit—day-to-day less moderated—center-right forces.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">The first camp, referred to as the <em>regressive left,</em> which is a group that encompasses old-left Marxists with the pseudo-anarchist neo-Marxist left that emerged after the 2008 crisis—that oscillates between a nostalgia for the Soviet Union, and the dream of "going back" to a localist ethnic-based post-modern <b><em>eutopia</em></b> ("the good place"). These groups, though they are present on the fringes of political life (surviving in the media, with reduced parliamentary seats", and academia), are very loud— putting pressure on public policy and making noise in the public discourse.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">The second group, we can define as the <em>overly-liberal radical-centrists,</em> who mostly governed Europe— either by their own parties, or as incorporations around the social-democratic parties or center-right ones (or what is left of those). These groups believe that (a post-republican form) <em>liberalism</em> is (or should be) a universal ideology, and by the radicalization of liberal principles— like "democracy", "free speech", "free trade", a green social market economy, and the liberal "rule-based world order"— society will become a liberal modern <em>quasi-utopia</em>, constituted by aeroponic (rootless) cosmopolitan individuals, pursuing their personal goals (without a common shared project), while emanating universal tolerance and good will.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">The third group, which we can define quasi-progressive, is the moderate Christian-democratic center-right. Which, among radical-liberals, was the other force that governed Europe in the last decades. They had largely (not totally) abandoned the ideas of the ancient regime—toward incorporating a more liberal worldview, progressive social policies, while maintaining some sense of cultural Christianity and decaffeinated conservatism.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">All these three groups—that were theorized decades or even centuries ago—in one way or another have been hegemonic in the last three decades — but now, after decades of failed policies, naive proposals, inaction and overall confusion, their power and reputation are <b>being dissolving quickly</b>, due to the contestation and general emergence of the <em>reactionary-international</em> and overall populist movements, <b>that day-to-day continues to grow.</b></p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="po-sidebar-text-1">
                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>A new regional Political landscape</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">The deterioration of general living conditions in the region, and the incipient emergence of the <em>Trumpist</em> European medieval far right, under the present contextual circumstances, are on the way of <b>reaching an irreversible point.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Decades of stagnation, the lack of a collective project with direction, and persistent problems (with little or no response)—are leading to a <b>widespread growing disenchantment</b> of the average person, who is becoming apathetic to general political life, and ends up supporting the medieval far-right or some fringe radical-leftists, simply because they are "something different". Without knowing that, these groups will not solve anything, and will make the situation even worse.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">The alternative for a better Europe—one that has to deal properly with the massive challenges that the region faces<b>—should not be between the unresponsive and outdated status quo, the Trump-sponsored far-right, or the regressive left.</b> We have the duty to <b>formulate something new</b>, more innovative, fresh, which learns from last developments in the social sciences, adapted to the present and future challenges that Europe needs to face.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Luckily, times of crisis (like the one we are in now), are non-linear times, which bring <b>space for rapid transformation</b>, around a new window of opportunity, that can channel capacities for sociopolitical innovation. Among those lines, a new project has to move forward, to break pre-conceptions about politics, learn from the past, and put forward novel answers.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="po-sidebar-text-1">
                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>Towards where?</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">The question of how to articulate new political action is definitely <b>not easy:</b> it requires deep theoretical development, debate, improvement through trial and error, and time. Nevertheless, there are some understandings, orientations, and alignments that can be put forward as starting points:</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10"><b><em>A break from the past.</em></b> Present challenges cannot be faced with traditional ideas. To respond there is the need to think beyond what exists now— learning from these traditional movements, but moving away from them, towards new frameworks of thinking, including better ontological assumptions about reality, explanatory concept, and new normative proposals. This includes understanding that any of the traditional frameworks—liberalism, social democracy, new and old leftism, or conservatism— that have been hegemonic in the recent past, are insufficient (or in some cases not even useful) frameworks for the future.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10"><b><em>Transversal articulated action.</em></b> A transformation of the general European political landscape will require action in very different areas, not just action from political parties— but transversal action with a somewhat cohesive shared vision around many other sectors: including academia, media, business, labor unions, NGOs, military, bureaucracy, art, diplomacy, and with society at large, aligned toward a shared future-oriented project.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10"><b><em>A Geopolitical Europe.</em></b> Towards an integrated unitary European Union State, that recovers the notion of geopolitics as part of its existence (a capacity that the traditional forces have mostly delegated to the United States). With a single foreign policy, aimed towards transforming Europe into a bridge between the global West, the global East, and the global South.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10"><b><em>A Solid Open Europe.</em></b> A Europe that is built—by and for—everyone, not just "native Europeans". As part of the wider planetary project and effort towards a better civilization overall. An openness that is not naive, but solid and ordered, that deals with challenges related to cultural integration. Around the belief that a shared project is the way to go, one that goes beyond the naive form of cosmopolitanism or the ethnic-centric (often racist) vision that some sectors propose.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10"><b><em>A Next-Generation Mixed Economy.</em></b> The traditional <em>social market economy</em> has reached its limits, and no longer fits today's emerging hyper-competitive, fragmented global order. A more coordinated economic model will be needed, centered on rebuilding clean industrial capacities, an innovative service sector, and ensuring a self-resilient agricultural base. This approach should be tailored towards a wider coordination of private companies (of all sizes), labor unions, the State sector, and the alternative economy (cooperatives, not-for-profit and community-owned companies) — within a good regulation framework.

                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">Beyond proposing new ideas around—that can contribute to the overall reformulation of the European political landscape—the purpose of this project is to <b>articulate a <em>New Political Space</em>.</b> Under the understanding that <b>traditional European political parties cannot deliver next-generation proposals and bold action</b> to counteract the anti-European regressive forces— because they are anchored in outdated frameworks of thinking, fatigued identities, a poor reputation around a negative track record, disorientation, or even fear.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">To contribute to this reformulation, the mission behind this project <b>is to develop and deploy a new political organizational initiative</b> that can contribute to reforming (and refreshing) the European political landscape. Tailored to propose and implement <b>new proposals</b> to give answers to the (unresolved) persistent problems around, the challenges to come, seize the opportunities of the future, and engage in bold action.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">As bases, the project will encompass <b>ideas around different frameworks:</b> <em>political meta-modernism</em>, the <em>communitarian-liberal synthesis</em>, <em>future-oriented thinking</em>, a <em>next-generation mix economy</em>, <em>secularism</em>, a <em>planetary-wide identity</em> that incorporates <em>Europeanism</em>. Around values related to equality, sustainability, openness, encouraging criticism, expression, political and economic participation, and the overall capacity for everyone to have a thriving life.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Frameworks and values that have to be <b>translated to public policy and strategic action.</b> With the objectives of recovering European productive capacities, ensuring the affordability of life for everyone, accelerating European integration towards unitary Europe, enhancing security and defense, fighting against pollution and regenerating the ecosystem, and the overall compromise to help improve the planetary civilization.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">For that, by now, after developing a solid starting-point framework, action will be oriented <b>toward gathering sufficient organizational capacities</b> around an effort to establish a <b>European-wide political party</b> (within and beyond the European Union), with its autonomous branches in different European countries — articulated in a common strategy to build power that can be tailored to <b>contributing to do the needed transformations that Europe needs for these challenging emergent times.</b></p>
