                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">Our contemporary historical period is <b>marked by a growing <em>meta-crisis</em></b>, which questions our sense of the world that surrounds us and of which we are part of.</p>
                                
                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">These concatenated and interrelated crises manifest themselves with many repercussions: such as the climatic-environmental one, pandemics, growing warfare scenarios, social polarization and internal conflicts, psychological illness on the rise, huge power and of resource distribution inequalities, rapid technological unpredictable impacts, and many other multidimensional parallel processes that <b>challenge us as an ecosystem, as a species, as societies, and as people.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Crisis scenarios are not new, they have been part of history throughout the centuries, with repercussions that have (to varying degrees) devastated societies on multiple occasions. What marks us today is not so much the presence or absence of various crises and major challenges, <b>but the way we see them and how we react towards them.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Going through these past crises, through experience (and a lot of fortune), we have developed various ways of partially understanding the historical events and processes of our historical becoming, as well as on occasions multiple ways of organizing and re-organizing ourselves socially— which in one way or another <b>respond to particular historical periods</b> that framed the bases on how we understand the world, and how, consequently, we should act on it.</p>
                           
                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">For trying to respond to these new difficulties we face, and to seize the possible new opportunities that we have, we should understand (or at least somewhat partially) <b>where we came from, where we are in the present, and where we can go.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This is not an easy task, because beyond the difficulty of understanding the past, it is also necessary to develop <b>new ideas and principles of action that adapt to these new times</b>. That often imply replacing past paradigms that have clearly been insufficient to interpret the present and even more to navigate the future. Those traditional paradigms are now exhausted: both descriptively, to explain the past and present, and also normatively, to provide answers to the future.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">For this reason, the great historical paradigms-projects of the past that we identify (putting in the center the modern era as the base of the work) here— referring to <b><em>pre-modernism</em></b>, <b><em>modernism</em></b>, and consequently <b><em>postmodernism</em></b> have become somehow insufficient or even outdated. This new reality is forcing us to embrace <b><em>post-postmodern</em></b> frameworks that can fit into this present time. Which respects and integrates the good contributions of the previous paradigms and overcomes what is not useful or accurate.</p>
                           
                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">These historical and axiological macro-categories—these great "isms"—mentioned above denote <b>generalized structures of feeling, senses and sensitivities around the concept of time:</b> since each of them encompasses different cognitive, explanatory and sociocultural frameworks, which are anchored as expanded points of references that prevail in societies in certain historical times. These, in one way or another, structure generalized frameworks of concepts, preferences, belongings, and guidelines for sociopolitical action.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In this way, here considering the need to briefly review these diverse historical macro-paradigms, in order to then try to <b>explore certain guidelines of possible new <em>post-postmodern</em> projects</b> (which come after postmodernity), anchored in new presumed emergent temporalities.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Just to mention, the labels that are used here, are not intended to have any specific positive or negative connotation in the normative sense, they are just possible (among other) conceptual ways of labeling and characterizing historical phenomena respectively.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p class="leading-26 pb-20">In the pre-modern vision of history, events are mostly seen as something natural and irreversible: either something that came from the gods, characteristic of the theocentric conceptions, or as something part of nature or the universe itself, characteristic of animism or the diverse cosmocentric and cyclical views of history.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26">With the glasses of pre-modernity, <b>mostly nothing could be done in the face of crises</b> and nothing would improve the situation of future generations: everything that happened was <b>anchored in factors of a higher order</b>— and therefore, social action did not make much sense in terms of the autonomy to decide over the future.</p>
                                
                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In general, this way of seeing history and the values ​​that it entails has been abandoned or attenuated in the great part of contemporary societies (at different degrees across the regions). Mainly because of the impact of the multiple processes of modernization of thinking and structural transformations that we have been passing through in recent times.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Nevertheless, pre-modern thinking still persists (and even grows) in many places—examples of this can be the solid theocentric political regimes in some places, the active appeal for a return to previous orders, the strengthening of conservatism in western societies, or the calls for returning to a state of nature-primitivity like the hunter-gatherers times.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Going back to these orders that have an origin in the distant past—by which we have lived through a great part of our history on this planet—clearly cannot be reliable references of how the world functions, or much less respond to the great challenges we face today as a global civilization.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This does not mean taking away from account and reincorporating some of the many positive elements that can be learned from these pre-modern paradigms, which modernity abruptly and erroneously decided to erase.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="po-sidebar-text-1">
                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>The modern project</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">Later, with the becoming of modernity, and of the subsequent anthropocentrism and technocentrism that it entailed—we began to see crises and calamities as situations avoidable (or recoverable) by human action, or even as intermediate historical processes of something that was necessarily going towards a better world.</p>

                                <div style="position: relative; margin: 0 0 20px 0; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Under this paradigm, opportunities to improve were an <b>autonomous-conscious rational</b> decisions to follow— especially through the implementation of scientific knowledge, technology, industrialization, ethical-moral universalism, the ideas of development, among many other related ideas. Which entitled a strong intergenerational optimism towards a supposed <b><em>cuasi-utopian</em></b> <b>linear future</b> of presumed generalized abundance and peace.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">These ideals, concepts, cultural feelings and frameworks of reference were <b>shared in a certain way by all modern political projects</b> and ideologies of different nature.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Modern ideologies of social order have been various and very prevalent: such as the first variants of liberalism, socialism, communism, capitalism, democracy, civic nationalism, or the new developments related to eco-modernism, among many others which, that in some way, still coexist with us.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">But especially in the last hundred years, the modern and optimistic vision of seeing (and hoping for) history, and responding "rationally" to the crises <b>began to deteriorate.</b> Especially due to the various war calamities, industrial genocides, economic crises of great magnitude, the growing environmental-ecosystemic devastation, violence and systematic exploitation of populations and regions, the strong concentration of power and resources in small elites, among many other dynamics that the <b>modernist projects failed to achieve.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Despite many positive aspects about modernity, such as the scientific method (that is omnipresent today), the massification of transportation and basic consumption-goods, information technologies, industrial automation, the idea of ​​human rights or political participation, among so many other modern products— modernism is <b>not presented as a completed paradigm to follow either.</b> Since related—and consequent—to some theoretical inconsistencies of it, has also brought many negative consequences due technological over-optimism, the overtrust of human knowledge, the over-trust in human capacities and good-intentions, or the use of rational-orders designed to reinforce, hide and normalize asymmetries and highly unjust power hierarchies.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">Faced with the decline of modernity, postmodernity begins to emerge by the influence of the diverse postmodern projects, <b>especially in regions with a "western" matrix.</b> Which manifested itself in various deployments dedicated not only to pointing out the crises and devastation attributed to modernism, but also aimed to question and <em>deconstruct</em> the basic pillars that sustained this modernity— among them, anthropocentrism, the objectivity and neutrality of knowledge, technological optimism, <em>developmentalism</em>, the concept of historical linearity and many others references to which the modern project refers.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">With its upswing, the postmodern project began to propose new bases for seeing history and questioning the prevailing modern ways of organizing society. <b>It promoted bases which opposed to the modern project:</b> such as a critique of the great historical projects (meta-narratives), relativism, perspectivism, subjectivism, existentialism, ethical-moral nihilism, language-centrism, indeterminism and a generalized pessimism, among many other related notions.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">With this view, historical developments and crises are <b>interpreted as part of the existence of the "subject",</b> around the understanding that <b>nothing can be done about them</b>— since the notion of a predictable historical future itself has no sense. In that way, according to postmodernism, the whole notion of progress and prosperity (that are modern concepts) are itself meaningless. Thus, historical events are something <b>unintelligible, inevitable, meaningless, and anchored in a perpetual struggle for power, without any end or direction</b>— that gives rise to an ahistorical, isolated and timeless historical understanding.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">The postmodern ideology <b>permeated different premodern and modern social structures and widespread cultural codes:</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">For example, fostered the conversion of a modern industrial-centralist capitalism, towards a market-centric post-political ideology— characterized by the <em>commodification</em> of everyday life, and the presence of isolated-atomized consumers with a sense of <em>historical amnesia</em>, immersed in some sort of pseudo-horizontal <em>presentism</em>.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Or also, can be associated with the emergence of "<em>new left</em>" movements, which related to an over-engaged endless emphasis on <em>micropower</em> analyzes and identity conflicts— that in general have an active pursuit for fragmentation, decentralization, distribution, and the dismantling of all existing and possible macro-socio-organizational structures. With the aim of reaching a kind of <b><em>eutopia</em></b> (the "good place") based on plural-atomized agents that return to small-scale counter-cultural community places.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In itself, despite its impact, postmodernism was—and still is—not so much a concrete sociopolitical project (as modernism was), but rather an anti-modern <b>counter-movement</b>, a critical discourse and an epistemological conception that questions the parameters that precede it. Besides having permeated some social structures in one way or another, it never became a concrete strong movement either, and much less coming to propose a proper idea of ​​a better future for society respectively.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">So, beyond learning from the need to have a continuous attitude of active criticism of the established—and to be established—social and cognitive orders, the postmodern project <b>is clearly not a paradigm of reference that can rethink the present and build-up the future.</b> Because is unable to give answers for the enormous challenges that we face as a civilization; which, beyond its important internal inconsistencies, <b>it denies the very possibility of creating macro-social changes towards a proper better and more anti-fragile models of social organization.</b></p>

                                <h3 class="sec-title font-bold text-32 leading-32 pt-40 pb-20"><b>After postmodernism</b></h3>
                                <p class="leading-26 pb-10">Nowadays, in parallel to the multiple socioeconomic, geopolitical and environmental crises that confront us, in some way some theorists started to notice that there is <b>the emergence of a new structure of feeling and historical sensitivity that goes beyond pre-modernism, modernism and the postmodernism</b>— which to a greater or lesser extent is expanding in the different regions of the planet impacted by the strong present globalization and growing problems.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This presumed emergent new cultural feeling-sensitivity is framed in a time marked by the "end of the end of history": it is apparently presented as a possible <b>oscillation, superation, and integration-synthesis</b> around the various previous frameworks and references.</p>es.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Thus, this new apparent <em>proto-time</em>, <b>recovers the notion of temporality and future</b>, anchored in the coexistence of a <b>sense of rejection towards great stories and pessimism, with the capacity (and need) of commitment to change and hope</b>— noticing that the future can be better through the incorporation and innovation of new learnings and responses, framed in the application of novel epistemological, technological and sociocultural developments.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Although it is difficult to grasp something that is just in its initial stages, many authors have begun to refer to it by appealing to certain new labels, and consequently, trying to characterize certain qualities and dimensions of these new <em>post-postmodern</em> expressions.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Among these emerging conceptualizations, has become widely known the concept of <em>meta-modernism</em> (Vermeulen, & Van der Akker, 2010; Van den Akker, Gibbons, & Vermeulen, 2017), defined as: <em>A "structure of feeling" and an open cultural logic that emerges, reacts, and oscillates between modern engagement and postmodern disenchantment-detachment, both as a synthesis, integration and overcoming of the two</em>.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Other later definitions expanded, modified or even relabeled the concept— to include different areas of application beyond cultural theory (to politics, ethics, and ontology), or even towards breaking with the supposed linearity of it.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In some sense, the concept comes in the form of labels as "informed naivety", "pragmatic-idealism", "magical realism", "playful seriousness", "cautious optimism", and many other concepts apparently contradictory, but that denote a positive substance in response to recent events and present challenges.</p>



                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Here, for practical terms of encompassing different ideas and conceptualizations, it is considered appropriate to use the label of <b><em>post-postmodernism</em></b>, or simply what "comes after" postmodernism— and therefore, also after modernism and premodernism. Being an intentionally vague and open terminology, concretely marks a temporal and conceptual break with previous periods and, consequently, leaves open the possibility of new interpretations and developments.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">This emergent post-postmodern era, <b>invites us to overcome postmodernity by thinking back to the notion of the future</b>, not from a linear and mechanistic perspective of temporality (as modernism invited), but from an open vision, <b>based on complex and critical thinking, engaging in <em>deconstruction</em> oriented towards construction.</b></p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Post-postmodernism can be interpreted as a culture that has an <b>active seek towards <em>protopia</em>:</b> referred to a process-situation of persistent and continuous social and personal improvements anchored in a non-linear, never-ending, post-utopian, and not-guaranteed historical progress.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In other words, this period that comes after post-modernity, <b>opens a time of construction (or reconstruction)</b>, which comes later and through deconstruction and integration— thus synthesizing the coexistence and incorporation of categories previously (and erroneously) understood as contradictory: such as order and chaos, organization and fragmentation, science and art, the natural and the artificial, spiritual and the material, knowledge and uncertainty, the local and the global, centralization and decentralization, humility and greatness, or between the past, present and the future.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">In turn, more from a sociological perspective, referring to the new sociopolitical movements and developments, <em>post-postmodernity</em> will probably put an end to the previous historical-ontologies, macro-ideologies, the organizational models of the past and present, and the current geopolitical scheme-order that is already deteriorated. As well as the overcoming of the anti-organizational and fragmentary attitude of the postmodern project— by this, perhaps giving rise to new approaches such as <em>informed plurality</em>, transectionality, transubjectivity, integrative-integral theory, complexity thinking, and an endless number of new developments and products of socio-environmental studies-sciences that we have yet to see.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Although it is difficult to know in advance how this new temporality and value framework will unfold concretely, at least the present <b>invites us to rethink and re-represent ourselves</b> (both personally and collectively), <em>between</em> and <em>beyond</em> pre-modern, modern and postmodern projects and paradigms. Trying to elucidate—and choose—what is our place today and tomorrow in history, and consequently, start to dream again with the understanding of our limitations and the dangers that progress entails.</p>

                                <p class="leading-26 pt-10">Perhaps these new post-postmodern paradigms and developments will help us to navigate and overcome these great crises and challenges that we are going through as an ecosystem, as a species, as a civilization, and as people.</p>
